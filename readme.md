## Intro

A **basic linting set-up** you can add to any (node) project. These are opionated default configuration files. Please tweak them to your liking, don't take them 'as is'.

## Includes

- [EditorConfig][config]: helps to maintain a consistent coding styles across various editors and IDEs.
- [ESLint][eslint]: analyzes JavaScript to quickly find syntax problems (errors).
- [Stylelint][stylelint]: avoids errors and enforces conventions in your styles.
- [Prettier][prettier]: opinionated code formatter (style)

## Install

Most of these configurations work by installing a plugin for your text editor and then adding _configuration files_ to your project. You can add these `dotfiles` to your _existing project_, put them in the root of your directory. Or install them _globally_ on your machine by adding them to the root of your machine.

## Plugins

- Install the [EditorConfig plugin][ediplugin] for your text editor
- Install the [ESLint plugin][esplugin] for your text editor
- Install the [Stylelint plugin][styleplug] for your text editor

_You'll probably don't need the prettier plugin, we extend prettier through ESLint._

## Support

I believe in making resources and products public and free (as in freedom, not free as in free frappuccinos) so people can build upon them. If you like my resources and products you can consider [supporting me][support].
